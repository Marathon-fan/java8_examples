## 1 Lambda
some examples.

## 2 Interface(Deafult Methods, @FunctionalInterface)
Conceptually, a functional interface has exactly one abstract method. 
The interface can also declare the abstract methods from the java.lang.Object class, but still the interface can be called as a Functional Interface.
As can be seen in the example(functionalInterface_example1), when using lambda expression, the code is much shorter than that of using anonymous class.
